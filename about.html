        <p>I'm currentyly studying Innovation and Technology with Management at the University of Salford and I must say it is very much fun as I am learning alot about different coding techniques, software tools for e.g GitHub and so forth. </p>
        <p>I was able to participate in a MS Word Specialist exam and achieved a certification which will really help me when I graduate. During the summer time I started my internship programme where I worked as an operational manager at a company called Sodexo which is under the healthcare management Industry. This helped significantly as it was my very first work experience in the corporae field and because of that I definitely feel aot more confident for opportunities that may present themselves during 2nd year university</p>
        <h3>Some key responsabilities I managed:</h3>
        <p>1. Logistics and Resource Management</p>
        <p>2. Data-Driven Decision Making</p>
        <p>3. Compliance and Risk Management</p>
